Experimental community BMTC bus tracking app which aims to be accurate in tracking and not navigation.

## Theory
- based on BMTC gtfs data, https://github.com/Vonter/bmtc-gtfs, we can plot all stops on map
- take user gps coords, and find closest stops to their location
- before start of tracking, show all routes based on closest stops
- once a route is chosen for tracking, ask if they're in the bus
- if yes, take them as a source of data and broadcast location to the P2P room
- every person that joins the same route connects via WebRTC and receives live GPS from feeders
- cluster nearby buses on the map, show bus markers with pulsing beacon

## Stack
- Preact + Signals for UI reactivity
- GenosDB (WebRTC + Nostr signaling) for P2P networking
- SQLite (sqlocal) for local GTFS stop/route data
- Leaflet + OpenStreetMap for map rendering
- Tailwind CSS

## Architecture
- single GenosDB instance per session, channels scoped per route (`gps-{routeId}`)
- feeder broadcasts GPS every 5s, consumers listen on the same channel
- first GPS message from a peer auto-registers them as a feeder — no separate handshake
- stale feeders expire after 2 min of inactivity
- SVG markers: red pin for stops, blue bus icon with pulsing beacon ring for active feeders

## Measures
**Bucketing / clustering** — multiple feeders on the same route are grouped using a greedy
clustering algorithm with a 50m haversine distance threshold. Feeders within 50m of each other
merge into a single cluster marker showing the count (e.g. "3 buses"). A pivot is picked from
the remaining feeders, all feeders within 50m of the pivot are grouped, and the process repeats
for the leftovers. The cluster center is the average lat/lon of all grouped feeders.

**Smart session revive** — on page reload, the app checks if the user had a chosen route/stop
(persisted in localStorage). Instead of blindly rejoining, it queries all stops on that route
from the local SQLite DB, then uses haversine distance to check if the user's current GPS
position is within 500m of any route stop. If close — revives the P2P session and resumes
tracking. If too far (e.g. user went home) — clears the stale persisted state so they start
fresh.

## Challenges
- accuracy of data <- based on gps location permissions, coordinates may or may not be on road
- human errors in choosing wrong route and then tracking may send completely different coordinates for the route
- e.g. a bus can be going from whitefield to majestic, but someone in E-City, may start sending tracking data and all is messed up
- P2P connectivity — WebRTC may fail on restrictive NATs without TURN servers
- handling lot of live tracking data, in memory or disk

## Implementation details
- init map and plot user location
- extract all stops from db and show closest stops as red pin markers
- once a stop is chosen, query routes serving that stop
- once a route is chosen, join the P2P room and the route's GPS channel
- if inside the bus, start broadcasting GPS every 5s — you become a feeder
- if watching, receive GPS from feeders in the room and plot as blue bus markers with beacon
- buses within 50m of each other cluster into a single marker showing count
- on page reload, smart revive checks GPS proximity to route stops before rejoining
